# Snapshot Proposal Graph

Simple Webpage to create a network graph of votes for a Snapshot proposal.

The graph uses the voting power of a vote for a specific proposal to determine the size of a node.

It also shows the what accounts delegated to the vote.

Note: Delegation might not be 100% correct at this point in time, as it takes the latest state of the delegate registry and not at the time of the proposal vote.
